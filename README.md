## Concert Finder 
Concert Finder is a Command Line Interface application that prompts the user for their name and will ask what type of show they would like to see. The goal of the application is to allow the user to find a concert based off their inputs. Once the user responds with the genre they would like to see a list of artists, the venue, and the day they show will be played appears. Our goal is to have that user select from the list of shows presented to determine the address of the venue. The user can then decide if they want to keep searchig for additional shows or not.
